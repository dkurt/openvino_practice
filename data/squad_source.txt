Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that
was lying under the table: she opened it, and
found in it a very small cake, on which the
words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in
currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “ and if
it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key ;
and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep
under the door; so either way I’ll get into the
garden, and I don’t care which happens !”
