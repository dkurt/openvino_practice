# Reinforcement Learning

This module asks to solve one of `gym` environments.
Check out `try_gym()` function to get perception of what `gym` is about.
To complete this module you should:
1. implement
    i. `Agent`'s methods. Hyperparamthers `ALPHA`, `GAMMA` are initialized for you
    ii. A part of `train()` function
2. Add `q_values.npy` file saved by `agent.save(WEIGHTS_PATH)`

## Details

* Install dependencies:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Modify [`reinforcement_learning.py`](reinforcement_learning.py) and run it. It takes about 10 minutes to train.
* Run a test Python script:

```sh
python3 test_reinforcement_learning.py
```

* Add `q_values.npy` file
